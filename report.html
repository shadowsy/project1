        <p class="paragraph">Suyu Wang made a website about cit 121program. Overall, she did an excellent job. Her
            website introduced the cit 121 program and make me understand the relationship between cit and 121 program.
            I like her design about photos.It's so interesting on the top of picture. I am a student in this the
            program. I think this website will attract more attention to this program. At the same time, I have some
            suggestions. FIrst, plese aviod narrow contents. It will make people lost interest to read it. Second,
            make the form more complete. A complete form can get more information. </p>
