            The project is a learning plan jointly developed by Changshu Institute of Technology and the US partner
            university. The US university regularly sends teachers to the school to teach. The project adopts bilingual
            teaching combined with full English teaching, and intensive English training before going abroad. The
            project students go to the United States to study for two years and meet the degree requirements and
            graduation requirements of the two universities in China and the United States. The students of the project
            have diplomas and degrees from Chinese and American universities and a good record of entry and exit to the
            United States. After graduation, they will continue their studies in the United States and will be easily
            awarded scholarships. More than 70% of our graduates are studying in the top 50 universities in the United
            States. After graduation, most of the project students have worked in financial institutions, banks and
            Fortune 500 companies. Some graduates obtain a US work visa and work in the US.</p>
